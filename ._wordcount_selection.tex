Finally, having identified neurons that switch the states of the behavior we will use specific perturbation of activity or structure to establish causal links. For this we will approach the problem with a suite of complementary methods. 1) Single cell laser ablation. Using a two-photon microscope with a second, high power laser path, we can ablate individual neurons selectively based on activity or genetic markers. 2) Optogenetics. In cases where we have a specific genetic promoter (e.g. the raphe neurons) we can express optogenetic effectors that allow reversible up or down regulation of activity with spatial and temporal specificity during behavior. 3) Pharmacology. We will test the role of different neurotransmitter pathways with drugs such as PCPA, which depletes serotonin.
